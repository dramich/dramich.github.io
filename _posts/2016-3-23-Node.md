title: Node Static File Serving
---

So, static file serving in Node. The Internet says to just use express because it is much easier, but what if you wanted to do it the hard way? Let us look at how we could go about that. 

We are going to assume you already have the basic server setup and are ready to respond to a simple request just asking for a static file. 



```javascript
function handleRequest(req, res) {
  };
```
This is going to setup a very basic request handler that is just going to take a GET request and respond with our file.  


```javascript
function handleRequest(req, res) {
  var index = path.join(__dirname, '../web/public/index.html')
  fs.readFile(index, function(err, data){
  })
};
```
Now we are going to setup a variable to hold the actual link to the file and setup the read. __dirname is going to give you the directory the currently executing code resides in and path.join() is going to take your current directory plus your addition path and combine them. 

fs.readFile is going to read the entire contents of your file then pass it into a callback through the data argument. If there is an error you can access it through the first argument.  


```javascript
function handleRequest(req, res) {
  var index = path.join(__dirname, '../web/public/index.html')
  fs.readFile(index, function(err, data){
    if (err){
      res.end(err);
    } else {
      res.end(data)
    }
  })
};
```

And in this final piece we are going to setup a very basic response to the original request. If an err object exists we are going to return that error to the requester. If there is no error we are going to respond with the data of the file.
